# font-condenser

Squishes font width a bit in order to have better code readability. 

For font editing this project uses fontforge python.

Idea for python script comes from this [blog](https://horstmann.com/unblog/2010-11-22/fonts.html) and this [repo](https://github.com/N-R-K/NRK-Mono/blob/master/condenser.py).
